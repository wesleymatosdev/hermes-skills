# Phase 2.5 and the Discoverability Check

### Phase 2.5: Selective Refresh Check

After writing the new learning, decide whether this new solution is evidence that older docs should be refreshed.

`ce-compound-refresh` is **not** a default follow-up. Use it selectively when the new learning suggests an older learning or pattern doc may now be inaccurate.

It makes sense to invoke `ce-compound-refresh` when one or more of these are true:

1. A related learning or pattern doc recommends an approach that the new fix now contradicts
2. The new fix clearly supersedes an older documented solution
3. The current work involved a refactor, migration, rename, or dependency upgrade that likely invalidated references in older docs
4. A pattern doc now looks overly broad, outdated, or no longer supported by the refreshed reality
5. The Related Docs Finder surfaced high-confidence refresh candidates in the same problem space
6. The Related Docs Finder reported **moderate overlap** with an existing doc — there may be consolidation opportunities that benefit from a focused review

It does **not** make sense to invoke `ce-compound-refresh` when:

1. No related docs were found
2. Related docs still appear consistent with the new learning
3. The overlap is superficial and does not change prior guidance
4. Refresh would require a broad historical review with weak evidence

Use these rules:

- If there is **one obvious stale candidate**, invoke `ce-compound-refresh` with a narrow scope hint after the new learning is written
- If there are **multiple candidates in the same area**, ask the user whether to run a targeted refresh for that module, category, or pattern set
- If context is already tight or you are in lightweight mode, do not expand into a broad refresh automatically; instead recommend `ce-compound-refresh` as the next step with a scope hint
- **In non-interactive mode**, never invoke `ce-compound-refresh` and never ask the user. Surface the recommended scope hint in the terminal report's "Refresh recommendation" line and let the caller decide

**User-runnable refresh rendering.** When recommending rather than directly invoking `ce-compound-refresh`, default to `/ce-compound-refresh <scope>`; use `$ce-compound-refresh <scope>` only when the active host is Codex or explicitly documents dollar-prefixed skill invocation. Render only the invocation as inline code and output one form only. Agent-to-agent invocation remains semantic.

When invoking or recommending `ce-compound-refresh`, be explicit about the argument to pass. Prefer the narrowest useful scope:

- **Specific file** when one learning or pattern doc is the likely stale artifact
- **Module or component name** when several related docs may need review
- **Category name** when the drift is concentrated in one solutions area
- **Pattern filename or pattern topic** when the stale guidance lives in `<root>/solutions/patterns/`

Examples:

- `ce-compound-refresh plugin-versioning-requirements`
- `ce-compound-refresh payments`
- `ce-compound-refresh performance-issues`
- `ce-compound-refresh critical-patterns`

A single scope hint may still expand to multiple related docs when the change is cross-cutting within one domain, category, or pattern area.

Do not invoke `ce-compound-refresh` without an argument unless the user explicitly wants a broad sweep.

Always capture the new learning first. Refresh is a targeted maintenance follow-up, not a prerequisite for documentation.

### Discoverability Check

After the learning is written and the refresh decision is made, check whether the project's instruction files would lead an agent to discover and search `<root>/solutions/` before starting work in a documented area. This runs every time — the knowledge store only compounds value when agents can find it.

1. Identify which root-level instruction files exist (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, or both). Read the file(s) and determine which holds the substantive content — one file may just be a shim that `@`-includes the other (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` containing only `@AGENTS.md`, or vice versa). The substantive file is the assessment and edit target; ignore shims. If neither file exists, skip this check entirely.
2. Assess whether an agent reading the instruction files would learn three things:
   - That a searchable knowledge store of documented solutions exists
   - Enough about its structure to search effectively (category organization, YAML frontmatter fields like `module`, `tags`, `problem_type`)
   - When to search it (before implementing features, debugging issues, or making decisions in documented areas — learnings may cover bugs, best practices, workflow patterns, or other institutional knowledge)

   This is a semantic assessment, not a string match. The information could be a line in an architecture section, a bullet in a gotchas section, spread across multiple places, or expressed without ever using the exact path `<root>/solutions/`. Use judgment — if an agent would reasonably discover and use the knowledge store after reading the file, the check passes.

3. If the spirit is already met, no action needed — move on.
4. If not:
   a. Based on the file's existing structure, tone, and density, identify where a mention fits naturally. Before creating a new section, check whether the information could be a single line in the closest related section — an architecture tree, a directory listing, a documentation section, or a conventions block. A line added to an existing section is almost always better than a new headed section. Only add a new section as a last resort when the file has clear sectioned structure and nothing is even remotely related.
   b. Draft the smallest addition that communicates the three things. Match the file's existing style and density. The addition should describe the knowledge store itself, not the plugin — an agent without the plugin should still find value in it.

      Keep the tone informational, not imperative. Express timing as description, not instruction — "relevant when implementing or debugging in documented areas" rather than "check before implementing or debugging." Imperative directives like "always search before implementing" cause redundant reads when a workflow already includes a dedicated search step. The goal is awareness: agents learn the folder exists and what's in it, then use their own judgment about when to consult it.

      **Substitute the concrete root in what you write.** The examples below show `<root>/solutions/`, but the instruction file is read by agents without this plugin (and by people), who cannot resolve `<root>`. When you insert the text, replace `<root>` with the resolved concrete path — the actual artifact directory, which is the default `docs` root's `solutions/` unless a `docs_root` is configured — never the literal placeholder.

      Examples of calibration (not templates — adapt to the file):

      When there's an existing directory listing or architecture section — add a line:
      ```
      <root>/solutions/  # documented solutions to past problems (bugs, best practices, workflow patterns), organized by category with YAML frontmatter (module, tags, problem_type)
      ```

      When nothing in the file is a natural fit — a small headed section is appropriate:
      ```
      ## Documented Solutions

      `<root>/solutions/` — documented solutions to past problems (bugs, best practices, workflow patterns), organized by category with YAML frontmatter (`module`, `tags`, `problem_type`). Relevant when implementing or debugging in documented areas.
      ```
   c. In full interactive mode, explain to the user why this matters — agents working in this repo (including fresh sessions, other tools, or collaborators without the plugin) won't know to check `<root>/solutions/` unless the instruction file surfaces it. Show the proposed change and where it would go, then use the platform's blocking question tool to get consent before making the edit: `AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code (call `ToolSearch` with `select:AskUserQuestion` first if its schema isn't loaded), `request_user_input` in Codex, `ask_question` in Antigravity CLI (`agy`), `ask_user` in Pi (requires the `pi-ask-user` extension). Fall back to presenting the proposal on the host's user-visible chat surface only when no blocking tool exists in the harness or the call errors (e.g., Codex edit modes) — not because a schema load is required. Never silently skip the question. In lightweight mode (interactive or non-interactive), output a one-liner note and move on. In full non-interactive mode, **do not edit instruction files** — surface the gap in the terminal report as `Instruction-file edit: gap noted, not applied` (headless scope is documentation capture, not project-config edits; a human-invoked interactive run applies the edit with consent)

5. **If `CONCEPTS.md` exists at repo root, run a parallel discoverability check for it.** Assess whether the instruction file would lead an agent to discover the project's shared domain vocabulary. Use the same workflow as the `<root>/solutions/` check above: same target file, same edit-placement judgment, same consent-then-edit interaction shape per mode. A line in an existing section is almost always better than a new headed section. Example calibration when nothing else fits:

   ```
   CONCEPTS.md  # shared domain vocabulary (entities, named processes, status concepts) — relevant when orienting to the codebase or discussing domain concepts
   ```

   **Skip this step entirely if `CONCEPTS.md` does not exist** — never nag for an artifact the project has not adopted. When skipped, this step produces no output and no edit.
