# Execution Strategy and Native Dispatch

Read this after the engine is resolved and before dispatching any worker or scheduling a parallel wave. The kernel owns the route-resolution and WIP/write gates; the selected engine owner carries any engine-specific lock. This file owns how native work is scheduled, packaged, dispatched, and integrated.

For the inline/subagent engine, **prefer subagents for any structured multi-unit plan** — each worker gets a fresh context window for one unit. **Parallelize independent units whenever it is safe**; fall back to serial only when parallel isn't safe or the harness can't isolate concurrent writes. Let the plan's `Dependencies` and `Files` drive batching: run an independent dependency layer together, then the next.

| Strategy | When to use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Inline** | Trivial work (1-2 files, no real decomposition), work needing user interaction mid-flight, or bare prompts that lack structured units |
| **Serial subagents** | The default for structured multi-unit plans whose units are dependent, few, or whose parallel-safety is uncertain. Fresh context per unit, executed in dependency order |
| **Parallel subagents** | Independent units (per the Parallel Safety Check) when you want the speed and the harness can isolate concurrent work. Run a dependency layer at once, then the next |

**Parallel Safety Check** — scheduling is separate from engine and workspace selection. Apply this gate to native and cross-model candidates before dispatching a wave:

1. Start only with units whose dependencies are already committed and whose peers in the same readiness layer do not depend on one another.
2. Map declared files to units from each candidate's `Files:` section, then reason beyond those declarations. File overlap is necessary but not sufficient: shared types/APIs/interfaces, migrations, lockfiles, generated artifacts/clients, registry or config/schema surfaces, and an environment singleton (one dev server/port, shared database, browser session, package install, or rate limit) all create contention.
3. Estimate expected merge and verification cost. Even isolated workers serialize when they share a contract or when reconciling their likely outputs is not obviously smaller and safer than serial authoring.
4. Dispatch together only when dependencies, declared files, semantic surfaces, runtime resources, and expected merge cost all support independence; **decline parallelism on uncertainty**. Speed is optional.
5. Require an isolated workspace for every concurrent worker. A synchronous native unit stays in the active checkout, but a shared-workspace worker runs serially regardless of declared file disjointness.
6. Cap concurrency at a bounded batch (~3-5 workers), even when more units appear independent.
7. Abort criteria: broad unplanned edits, semantic overlap, out-of-scope failures, or repeated collision disables further waves; preserve or finish affected work serially.

Isolation for native workers is the harness's job, under the body's boundary. Probe what your native subagent mechanism provides and pick the parallel path:
- **Harness-native isolated workers** — each worker edits an isolated workspace the harness manages: for example, Claude Code `Agent` with worktree isolation or a harness worker capability whose receipt confirms an isolated workspace. This works even when you are already inside a worktree because the harness-managed worktrees are peers, not nested. Parallelize only units that pass the Safety Check; isolation makes recovery possible, not overlap safe.
- **Shared workspace only** — subagents edit your working directory. Run them serially. Do not infer isolation from the presence of a subagent API; use only a capability the active harness actually exposes.
- **No subagent mechanism:** run inline.

**Native dispatch (inline/subagent engines only)** uses your harness's subagent/worker mechanism. Once a unit is selected for cross-model execution, use the loaded controller protocol for that unit; it must not re-enter this ordinary subagent dispatch.

Classify a rejected native dispatch by whether a worker launched: correct a pre-launch argument rejection once, leave capacity-limited work queued, and if another launch failure survives correction, execute that unit inline under the same unit packet and verification contract.

**Fresh worker invariant (native subagent dispatch only):** When dispatching an implementation unit to a native subagent worker, create a new worker context with no prior implementation-unit transcript. Bind the worker handle to exactly that unit: it may continue or recover the same unit, but never receive a different unit. Retire each handle after its unit is integrated; never retask it or retain idle implementation workers for reuse. Invoke an explicit close/release operation only when the active harness exposes one and assigns that lifecycle action to the caller. Inline execution creates no worker context or handle, so it has nothing to retire.

Give each native worker:
- The plan path plus a **bounded unit packet** and inherited authority — Goal Capsule, Definition of Done, the unit's section, the Verification Contract entries relevant to it, any referenced R/F/AE/KTD excerpts, **plus any Product Contract Key Decision whose `Governs R…` links name the unit's cited R-IDs** (its `session-settled:` annotation reaches the worker only through this reverse link — cited KTDs alone carry only planning-decision labels). A downstream worker may narrow that unit and authority, never broaden either. Do not send "read the whole plan" as the worker prompt. (For a legacy non-unified plan, the plan path for reference is acceptable.)
- The unit's Goal, Files, Approach, Execution note, Patterns, Test scenarios, Verification, and any resolved deferred questions for it.
- Instruction to check whether the unit's test scenarios cover all applicable categories (happy paths, edge cases, error paths, integration) and supplement gaps before writing tests.
- **Instruction to choose the unit's evidence strategy and gather the evidence** (see Evidence Strategy in Phase 2) — for behavior-bearing changes, honor the Execution note and default to proof-first or characterization-first: create/update/strengthen the test and observe the red failure or characterization baseline **before** changing production code. The worker is the only party that witnesses this, so it must capture it as it goes.
- **Instruction to report, in its final message, both (a) the file paths it changed and (b) the unit's verification evidence** — `behavior_changed`, existing tests inspected, tests added/changed or used unchanged, the red failure or characterization observed (when applicable), the verification run and result, and any deliberate no-test exception with its reason. The handoff is a text summary on most harnesses with no guaranteed diff, so reported paths are the orchestrator's starting hint (it still verifies the actual tree); the evidence fields are **not** reconstructable from the tree afterward, so a worker that omits them forces the orchestrator to re-derive or leave `verification_evidence` incomplete.
- **Do not commit.** Ordinary native workers implement and may run their *own unit's* focused tests in isolation as a self-check, but the **orchestrator owns staging, committing, and the authoritative test runs**. An external cross-model worker leaves its tree uncommitted under the body's boundary; the host's transport snapshots are change transport, never canonical commits. (Capability note: a harness that *reaps* the isolated workspace on worker completion — none of our current targets do — would instead require the worker to commit to its branch; confirm before assuming it.)

**Parallel subagent mode:** Commit ownership is split by isolation mode (see Phase 1 Step 4):
- **Worktree-isolated:** subagents may stage and commit inside their own worktree branch; the orchestrator merges those branches in dependency order after the batch.
- **Shared-directory fallback:** subagents do not commit; the orchestrator stages and commits each unit after the entire parallel batch completes.

**Shared-workspace constraints** — when subagents share your working directory (no isolation): they must not `git add`, commit, or run the full test suite concurrently (index corruption + test interference); the orchestrator does all of that after the batch. A worker may run a single focused unit test only if it touches no shared state.

**Permission mode:** Omit the `mode` parameter when dispatching subagents so the user's configured permission settings apply. Do not pass `mode: "auto"` — it overrides user-level settings like `bypassPermissions`.

**After each serial inline/subagent unit:** review the diff against the unit's scope and `Files:`, run the relevant tests, fix before starting the next (never on a broken tree), record the unit's verification evidence (from the worker's return when a worker ran), update the task list (never edit the plan body — progress lives in commits), and commit. If the unit used a native subagent worker, retire its handle (closing/releasing it only when the harness exposes that operation and assigns that lifecycle action to the caller), then dispatch the next subagent unit in a new worker context. An inline unit has no worker handle to retire; start the next unit directly.

**After a parallel inline/subagent batch — the orchestrator integrates; never trust the handoff summary alone:**
1. Wait for every worker in the batch to finish.
2. **Inspect the actual tree, not reported paths.** Determine what each worker really changed (`git status`/diff in its workspace or the shared dir). Reported paths are a hint; declared `Files:` are often incomplete — workers create/modify files the plan didn't anticipate.
3. **Detect real collisions and semantic contention** — compare actual paths plus shared contracts, generated/config surfaces, and verification effects. A clean merge is not proof of compatibility. Preserve or re-run colliding units on the advancing canonical base; never blind-merge them.
4. **Review, test, commit, and retire each unit in dependency order — the orchestrator owns commits.** Integrate one result, inspect actual scope, run authoritative verification, create its canonical commit, then immediately retire that unit's worker before considering the next. Never send the retired handle another implementation unit or keep it in an orchestrator-managed idle pool. Invoke an explicit close/release operation only when the harness exposes it and assigns that lifecycle action to the caller; otherwise completion is the worker's release boundary. Clean up an isolated workspace only when the harness assigns that cleanup to the caller and only after proving the unit's work was integrated — never infer manual cleanup commands from the provider name. Revalidate every remaining result against the advancing canonical tree. Capture each worker's returned verification evidence into the run's `verification_evidence` roll-up — if a worker omitted it, re-derive what the tree allows and mark the rest as unverified rather than fabricating a red-before-implementation observation the worker never reported.
5. Update the task list (progress lives in the commits).
6. Dispatch the next dependency layer only after every unit in the batch has been integrated and its worker retired. Any remaining isolated-workspace cleanup follows the active harness's ownership and lifecycle contract.

**Per-harness integration (examples — the universal flow above is the contract):**
- **Harness-owned worktree/branch:** integrate one branch in dependency order, verify, and commit before the next; on conflict abort and re-run or explicitly resolve that unit against the advanced tree.
- **Harness-owned uploaded change set:** accept one isolated result, inspect and verify it, commit it canonically, then release the worker before the next result.
- **Shared workspace:** no parallel batch is permitted; use the serial path.
- **External cross-model workspace:** follow the conditionally loaded cross-model parallel-wave protocol and controller receipts; ordinary branch-merge shortcuts do not apply.
