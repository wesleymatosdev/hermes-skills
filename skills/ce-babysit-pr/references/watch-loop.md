# Watch loop — scheduling, state, dedup, edge cases

Read this once per babysit session, before acting on the first tick's output. It defines *how ticks are scheduled per harness*, the *on-disk state contract*, the *claim→act→confirm dedup protocol* that makes ticks idempotent and crash-safe, and the *edge-case handling*. SKILL.md owns the ordering invariant; this file owns the mechanics.

## How the watch sustains itself

A skill's turn ends when it returns, so *the skill sets up its own loop* — nothing re-invokes it by magic. The robust, cross-harness-verified way is **not** to call a specific per-harness scheduler; it is to run a cheap deterministic background change-detector and **stay in-session**, woken when it signals:

- **`pr-snapshot watch`** is that detector — same fetch→diff on an interval, **no agent tokens**, prints one `BABYSIT_WAKE {reason,url,...}` line *only* on work to inspect (`actionable` for unresolved threads or failed CI; `feedback-candidate` for non-thread content awaiting resolver judgment; `branch-currency` for an item requiring claim, semantic inspection, or reconciliation) or a stop condition (`terminal` / `blocked-external` / `blocked-external-drained` / `blocked-failing` — a dispatched check left terminally red — / `base-ref-blocked` / `needs-human` / `merge-ready` after settle / `max-runtime` / `stop-signal` / `invocation-superseded`), then exits. A `feedback-candidate` that the resolver silent-drops is a normal classification outcome, not a detector false positive.
- At the fixed deadline, the final refresh preserves `terminal` and already-settled `merge-ready` stops; `max-runtime` outranks every non-terminal work/residual wake so the cap cannot start another agent round.
- The agent **backgrounds `watch` and waits for that line** with its harness's *background-and-wake* capability, runs a tick, and re-arms. The loop lives **in the current session**, so it keeps every decision the conversation made — declined nits, a reviewer judged wrong, the user's mid-run steering — and spends reasoning only when something changed.

Watcher ownership is **latest-valid-watcher-wins**. A newer invocation cancels an older invocation whose first fetch is still in flight, preventing network completion order from stealing ownership back. That candidate reservation does not displace the active watcher: only a successful first snapshot atomically supersedes and gracefully terminates it, while a failed preflight leaves it healthy and active. Wakes and snapshots carry `watch_generation`. On delivery, compare the wake generation with a fresh snapshot: discard a stale wake and coalesce it into that current read; if the generation matches but the attention set already cleared, do no work. An `invocation-superseded` wake ends the old loop without a tick or re-arm because a later explicit invocation owns the state. Replacement preserves `last_change_at`, `invocation_started_at`, and `invocation_budget_seconds`, so a fresh watcher polls immediately without adding a new settle delay or renewing the budget.

The needed capability is generic — *run a background process and be woken when it emits a line, without ending the turn* — so **describe the capability and use whatever tool the harness has**, rather than hardcoding a scheduler. A skill drives **tool calls**, never user-typed slash commands. Known instances (examples, not a required list; verified live this session):

| Harness | Background-and-wake tool the agent uses | Durable beyond the session? |
|---------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Claude Code (CLI) | background `Bash` + a `Monitor`/wait; or `ScheduleWakeup` under `/loop` | No (session-bound) — cron for durable |
| Grok (CLI/TUI) | background `run_terminal_command` + `get_command_or_subagent_output`; `scheduler_create --durable` for a cross-session schedule | Yes via `scheduler_create --durable` (60s min, 7d) |
| Cursor (CLI) | `Shell` background + `notify_on_output` sentinel (its `/loop` is user-typed, **not** skill-invocable) | No (session-bound) |
| Codex (CLI) | a runtime-owned background exec that re-runs the tick (a detached `nohup` is **reaped** when the tool call ends) | No (session-bound) |
| GUI apps / headless / unknown | none reliable → **checkpoint** | — |

**User-runnable resume syntax.** Whenever this reference tells the skill to print or copy a resume invocation, default to `/ce-babysit-pr <url>` and, when the run posture is not `target`, append the same `posture:stack-ready` or `posture:stack-land` token so checkpoint / durable / session re-entry keeps stack scope. Use `$ce-babysit-pr <url> [posture:…]` only when the active host is Codex or explicitly documents dollar-prefixed skill invocation. Render only the invocation as inline code and output one form only.

**Checkpoint (the floor):** when no background-and-wake capability exists, run one tick, persist, report, and print the exact host-rendered re-run invocation — monitoring is *paused*, say so plainly. Because every tick is disk-resumable, checkpoint is the same loop hand-cranked; the in-session watch only automates the crank. Never fake a loop with a foreground `sleep` (blocked on Claude Code, discouraged elsewhere) or a detached `nohup` (reaped/unsupported on several harnesses).

**Durability:** the in-session watch dies with the session; re-invoking resumes from disk (`/tmp` persists across ticks). For an unattended multi-day watch, escalate to a durable scheduler (Grok `scheduler_create --durable`, or cron running `<cli> exec '<host-rendered resume invocation>'`) — a fresh headless run is context-blind, so persist consequential decisions to disk. **Shell env vars do not persist between separate tool calls** on any harness — re-set `SKILL_DIR`/`STATE_DIR` inline in every command.

## Cadence (the watch interval)

- `pr-snapshot watch --interval` is the poll cadence: ~2-3 min while active; widen to ~5-10 min when quiet — the detector is cheap, but each poll is a `gh` call, so respect rate limits.
- `--settle-seconds` (default 300) is the quiet window before a `merge-ready` wake, so the agent is roused to declare-ready only once the PR has actually cooled off, not every poll. Leave it unset on the normal arm — the script's default is the initial policy; the only invocation that sets it is the post-rejection re-arm in SKILL.md Step 3's merge-ready wake protocol.
- `--blocked-external-drain-seconds` is set only after an interactive approval-gate wake. Keep the active ~150s interval throughout this short 300/900/1800-second review drain: a quiet 5-10 minute poll could consume the entire signal-less tier. The persisted head-scoped review clock, not the arm time or broad merge-ready quiet clock, decides expiry.
- A push/mutation moves the head — re-arm `watch` (active cadence) so it reads the new state.
- Every re-arm presents the same `--invocation-id "$RUN_INVOCATION_ID" --session-started-at "$RUN_STARTED_AT" --invocation-budget-seconds "$RUN_BUDGET_SECONDS"`; the helper rejects a changed token, anchor, or budget. Only the first snapshot uses `--start-invocation`; only a managed-stack layer transition uses `--continue-invocation`.
- Honor GitHub rate-limit reset headers; back off on `403`/`429`.
- After any mutation, re-snapshot at the *start of the next tick*, not mid-tick.

## Pipeline mode bound (`mode:pipeline`)

An orchestrator (`lfg`) drives ticks in-line and needs the loop to terminate. Run ticks back-to-back until the stop below. **To wait for CI to progress between ticks, use the harness's native non-blocking wait — never a bare foreground `sleep`** (blocked on Claude Code, discouraged elsewhere): Claude Code's `Monitor` until-loop; Grok's `get_command_or_subagent_output(timeout_ms=…)` or a `monitor`; Cursor's `Await` on a backgrounded `gh pr checks --watch`. If the harness has no non-blocking wait, do one tick and return control to the orchestrator rather than busy-spinning. Loop until:

- **Report success only when** `all_checks_ok` is true, the actionable backlog and canonical `needs_human_residuals` set are empty, `mergeability_certain` is true, `merge_state_status == "CLEAN"`, `base_ref_blocker` and `stack_blocker` are null, `branch_currency_blocker` is null, and `unrequested_base_merge` is null. A red check, a human decision, an empty check rollup, uncertain merge/base/stack state, or an open/claimed/parked currency item is not success: keep ticking until it clears or the time budget expires; or
- when the canonical set is non-empty and no autonomous work remains, return `{ status: "needs-human", checks_terminal, fixes_applied, residuals: needs_human_residuals }` immediately without waiting for human input or the budget; or
- a **budget** is hit: default **3 CI fix rounds** per head-lineage (mirrors `lfg`'s historical cap) and an overall time cap (~30-45 min). On budget-exhaust, the still-red checks and any `needs-human` items become residuals.

Never wait on the merge-ready settle window or human review in pipeline mode — those are interactive stops. A check stuck `IN_PROGRESS` past the time cap ends the run with a "CI still running" residual rather than blocking forever.

The round/time budget above is a **blunt cost floor**, not a convergence detector — it catches a runaway that never trips the trajectory-driven stop below. Prefer to stop *because it's demonstrably not converging*, not because a timer expired.

## Non-convergence (trigger → route → park → re-open)

A loop can churn without finishing: CI **ping-pong** (fix A surfaces B, fix B brings A back — often an emergent trade-off), a review-bot **treadmill** (each commit spawns fresh nits), or **wrong-approach whack-a-mole** (each nit is valid but the approach, e.g. a regex, is the problem). A raw attempt counter can't tell these from *legitimate progress* (four independent failures each fixed once) — so the decision is **agent reasoning over the trajectory**, and the split is strict:

- **`pr-snapshot` (babysit) ships facts.** The `trajectory` block is deterministic and coarse: `check_recur_max`/`recurring_checks` (a check that failed → cleared → failed again on a *new* head; same-head flapping is excluded, so this is not flaky noise), `unresolved_trend` + `new_threads_this_tick` (backlog growing / fresh threads arriving), `stream_alternations` (ci↔review bouncing — cross-stream churn only babysit can see), `heads_since_progress` (heads moved without a new low in open problems). Babysit **never** labels this "non-convergence."
- **The leaf judges.** When a trigger fires (the thresholds are in SKILL.md Step 2 — the single source of truth; do not re-list them here), pass the trajectory into that tick's `ce-debug`/`ce-resolve-pr-feedback` as **mandatory input**. It must either demonstrate progress (name the invariant the next bounded fix resolves) or return a `needs-human` that **parks the whole stream** with a `decision_context` (the tension/root, options, tradeoffs, its lean).

**The anti-cry-wolf line (put it to the leaf):** *progressive failure migration* — A fixed → B appears once → B fixed → done — is ordinary repair; **do not park.** *Oscillation* — A returns after B's fix, the failing set cycles, defects migrate X→Y→Z with the same invariant unsatisfied, or fix size grows superlinearly — is non-convergence; park. "We've tried a lot" is never enough.

**A third case the counter must not miss: a *correct* finding recurring across sibling sites.** When each new head brings a fresh thread that is *valid* and shares one root and treatment with an already-fixed one — not a wrong-approach cluster, not oscillation — the problem is a single fix with a multi-site blast radius surfacing one site per head; dripping it one-per-head is as wasteful as parking it is wrong. **Route it, don't decide it here:** pass the recurring feedback cluster **plus** the trajectory to `ce-resolve-pr-feedback` and request a **bounded-class assessment**. The resolver holds the diff and owns the call — it decides whether the sites are genuinely equivalent (same invariant, same fix, only behavior this PR touched), enumerates the concrete locations, and fixes the class in one pass. Babysit does **not** infer the root or the sites from the `trajectory` — those are churn counts, not semantic identity. If the resolver judges the sites *not* equivalent, it falls back to per-site; if it judges the shared root a wrong approach, it parks — unchanged from above.

**Guards:**

- **Moving-target ≠ non-convergence.** Base-branch merges, dep bumps, flaky infra, and bot-rule changes create unrelated new failures. Recurrence already excludes same-SHA flapping; still, don't park a failure the leaf attributes to an external cause rather than the approach.
- **Cross-stream contradiction.** If `ce-debug` concludes the review-requested behavior is invalid while `ce-resolve-pr-feedback` concludes it's required, that's a single **cross-stream** residual — don't arbitrarily park one side.
- **A current decision is a hard blocker with one lifetime condition.** It makes the PR *not* merge-ready until the shared answer transition consumes it or any frozen source observation changes/disappears. The latter invalidates the whole decision automatically and makes surviving ordinary sources actionable; it never counts as the human's answer. An explicit source `--disposition open` may cancel a covering decision when the agent has separately proved the observation is no longer the question, but no stream owns a route-specific reopen rule.

## On-disk state contract

State lives at `<scratch-root>/ce-babysit-pr/<host>-<owner>-<repo>-<pr>/state.json` (a stable, cross-invocation-reusable path so any later tick — scheduled or hand-run — finds it). The `<host>` segment (from the PR URL, `github.com` on the public host) is load-bearing for GitHub Enterprise: without it, two PRs sharing `owner/repo#N` on different hosts would reuse one `state.json` and cross-contaminate dispositions. The `pr-snapshot` script owns all reads and writes under a file lock. Shape:

`human_decisions` is the one durable decision set across review, CI, and branch currency. Source records retain only their ordinary open/dispatched/claimed facts; a current decision covers the exact observations frozen in its `sources`. The snapshot emits each unchanged payload in `needs_human_residuals` and pairs it with its `decision_id` in the `human_decisions` view for rendering and answer routing. Any covered observation changing or disappearing invalidates the whole decision and makes surviving ordinary sources actionable again; remote activity is never inferred to be an answer. `mark --answer-decision <decision_id> --answer-file <path>` is the only answer transition: it moves the exact record to `answered_human_decisions`, preserves the response while matching sources remain actionable, and prevents the unchanged evidence from immediately re-parking. Legacy parked records without a complete payload fail open.

A `check_key` is `"<workflow>/<name>"` (or `"<name>"` when there is no workflow) — stable across polls for the same head, which is all the dedup needs (see below). Each `snapshot` emits `changed_this_tick`, `quiet_seconds`, `invocation_id`, `invocation_started_at`, `invocation_elapsed_seconds`, `invocation_budget_seconds`, `invocation_remaining_seconds`, `persisted_state_created_at`, `persisted_state_age_seconds`, `pr_chain`, `stack_blocker`, the review-signal lifecycle fields, `blocked_external_first_seen_at`, `blocked_external_review_last_activity_at`, `blocked_external_review_quiet_seconds`, `blocked_external_review_moved_this_tick`, and the derived `trajectory` facts (see **Non-convergence** above). The blocked-external clock is head-scoped and narrower than `quiet_seconds`: external thread/comment/review movement, review-signal movement, or a new head resets it; check, base, stack, and disposition-only movement does not. `blocked_external_review_moved_this_tick` lets a newly started or changed lifecycle wake through an already-baselined gate so the agent can select the longer tier. `review_signal_identities` is the sorted set of current 👀 reactor identities; `review_signal_count` and `review_in_progress` remain count and boolean compatibility views. Identity-set changes are observable signal movement even when the count and boolean stay unchanged. Legacy state without identities migrates on its first identity-aware observation. `review_signal_seen_on_head` remains true if all observed 👀 disappear, so a fresh agent can distinguish an incomplete lifecycle from a head where no signal ever appeared; a new head resets it. The first snapshot starts one fixed invocation; later calls must match its token, anchor, and budget. Persisted-state age describes how long the resumable PR journal has existed and never contributes to the invocation cap. The chain probe is CLI-first: accept `gh stack view --json` only when it contains the target PR, then use the GraphQL fallback. Only a stack-field schema-unavailable response with a successful read-only default-branch lookup degrades to `absent`; auth, transport, rate-limit, malformed, other GraphQL, and failed default-branch probes stay `probe-error`. Ordinary open-PR base/head relationships classify manual dependencies only when no manager is confirmed. The `trajectory` sub-state is deterministic bookkeeping the script maintains; the leaves reason over the emitted facts.

## Claim → act → confirm (the dedup protocol)

The rule that makes ticks idempotent *and* crash-safe: **the snapshot never marks an item handled just from observing it.** An item leaves the actionable set only when the agent confirms it acted (via `mark`) or when remote truth removes it. So if a resolve/debug pass crashes, errors, or returns without finishing, the item is still actionable on the next tick — the loop cannot silently drop work.

- **Review threads.** A thread is actionable while it is unresolved and you have not recorded acting on it. After a resolve pass, `mark --thread <id> --disposition dispatched` handles an ordinary unresolved thread. The shared residual mark freezes its complete source observations without changing their dispositions. A later reviewer comment invalidates any covering decision and reopens every surviving sibling; it does not answer the decision. Every mark carries the active invocation tuple, so stale ticks cannot silence work in a newer invocation.
- **Non-thread feedback candidates** (top-level PR comments + review-submission bodies). These appear as `actionable.comments` when feedback has no inline thread. The detector excludes only empty bodies and never classifies content, authors, or posting surfaces; `ce-resolve` owns that judgment. Because there is no remote resolve, every passed candidate must either be marked `dispatched` or be covered by one validated current decision. A dispatched candidate stays silent across body edits because status bots routinely rewrite comments; an edit to a covered candidate invalidates the decision. A new comment has a new ID and is actionable. Both feedback surfaces remain one review stream for trajectory and backlog accounting.
- **CI checks.** A failing check on the current head is actionable until you `mark --check <key>`. A typed decision enters the same canonical set through the shared residual mark, never through check-specific decision state. A new head clears dispatch state, invalidates check-sourced residuals, and re-evaluates the decision against the new commit.

- **Current-base merge identity.** `base.historical_oid` is the PR's historical `baseRefOid`; it may legitimately differ after the base branch advances and never blocks by itself. `base.graphql_oid` comes from `baseRef.target.oid`, while `base.oid` comes from an independent exact ref read on `base.host`: the REST Git-ref endpoint first, then non-interactive `git ls-remote` (authenticated through the `gh` session via `gh auth git-credential`, so it needs no separately configured Git credential helper) only when REST returns 404. A mergeable result is current only when those live-base OIDs match and `potentialMergeCommit` names that base and the observed head as its two parents. Base movement between probes emits `race`; a temporarily absent generated merge emits `mergeability-pending`; failed, deleted, or malformed ref/identity reads emit `probe-error`. A `race` whose only mismatch is the test merge's base parent (head and live base agree) degrades to `stale-computation` after `STALE_MERGE_COMPUTATION_SECONDS` of stability and no longer blocks; `merge_computation_stale` carries the disclosure. Each disables `mergeability_certain`, emits no branch-currency item, wakes `base-ref-blocked`, and resets the settle clock when the identity changes so a later proven observation re-polls normally. `DIRTY` / `CONFLICTING` is the fallback: GitHub may omit `potentialMergeCommit`, so matching live-base observations make the conflict result usable without inventing a generated merge.
- **Branch currency.** `branch_currency` is the third attention stream. Its identity binds host-qualified live base repository/ref/OID, head SHA, merge status, and route. "Mergeable against the current base" and "head contains the latest base" are separate: only `BEHIND`, `DIRTY`, a branch-protection requirement, or an explicitly selected always-current policy requires maintenance. Ordinary historical base movement with GitHub reporting `CLEAN` does not. `UNKNOWN` mergeability or any non-null `base_ref_blocker` emits no item. Managed stacks and manager/relationship `probe-error` are excluded; a `normal-base` target may be independent or an eligible target-local manual dependency, and a root with open child dependents remains allowed. Never mutate those dependents.

  A current open item with carried `parked_semantic_fingerprints` must be previewed first. Compute the current fingerprint from sorted conflicted paths plus stage blob identities, excluding the base OID, and mark `--currency-inspected-fingerprint <fingerprint>`. Unchanged evidence remains parked; changed evidence retires the old park and reopens attention. Before either a host update or local merge, atomically mark the exact item with `--currency-key <currency_key> --currency-disposition claimed`, plus `--invocation-id "$RUN_INVOCATION_ID" --session-started-at "$RUN_STARTED_AT" --invocation-budget-seconds "$RUN_BUDGET_SECONDS"`. Stale invocation fencing and `max-runtime` take precedence over a new claim or mutation.

  Re-entry into `claimed` is reconciliation-only, never a direct resubmission. Record the observed recovery as `--currency-outcome mutation-observed`, `--currency-outcome proven-no-mutation`, or `--currency-outcome ambiguous`. Continue autonomously only through the recovery the recorded outcome leaves safe: reconcile an observed mutation toward confirmation. Exactly one retry follows only conclusive no-mutation proof and the engine backoff. Ambiguous recovery never retries or resubmits. Confirm the same exact item with `--currency-disposition confirmed`. Every terminal currency result with no safe autonomous continuation includes one complete `--residual-file` in that same locked mark with source `{ id: <currency_key>, kind: "currency" }`. Answers use the shared decision-ID transition above; branch currency has no separate answer state. Never transfer a claim or decision to a moved head/base observation.

`human_decisions`, `answered_human_decisions`, `ci_dispatched`, the thread and feedback dispositions, and `branch_currency_state` share the locked state journal. There is no second decision ledger or route-specific crash-recovery record. An unmarked review or CI item stays actionable, a current decision covers its exact observations, and a claimed currency item stays reconciliation-only until explicitly confirmed or handed to the shared decision boundary.

## Merge-readiness and the settle window

Do not re-derive "required checks" or required reviews — GitHub already computes them. Use `mergeability_certain`, `mergeable == "MERGEABLE"`, and `merge_state_status == "CLEAN"` for GitHub gates after the merge computation is bound to the current base and head, then require chain and branch currency to be clear. A managed target is ready only when `target_needs_rebase == false`; true or unknown emits `stack_blocker`. Any current `base_ref_blocker` or `branch_currency_blocker` blocks ready until fresh remote evidence clears it. A manual dependency can be ready relative to its parent but is not independently landable while that parent remains open. `UNSTABLE` means mergeable but a non-required check is red; `BLOCKED` means a required gate is unmet. The snapshot also emits `has_failing_checks` so you can act on a red check even while `merge_state_status` is `UNSTABLE`.

The settle window guards the most damaging false positive: "CI went green, told the user to merge, then feedback landed."

- The script stamps `last_change_at` whenever anything observable moves — a check status/conclusion, a thread's identity (added, edited, or resolved-away), the head SHA, `review_decision`, `mergeable`, `merge_state_status`, or the current 👀 reactor identity set. Each snapshot emits `quiet_seconds`.
- "Looks ready" requires `quiet_seconds >= 300` (default) on top of a CLEAN mergeable state and zero actionable backlog (threads **and** non-thread feedback). A reviewer or bot still working shows up as recent activity → `quiet_seconds` resets.
- A current-head review signal creates an incomplete lifecycle even if it later disappears. The detector blocks a live 👀 through 900 quiet seconds; the skill applies the same 15-minute floor to a disappeared/non-👀 signal, may extend once to 1800 seconds from concrete prior-round timing, and never re-arms past 30 quiet minutes after the last observable movement solely for the unchanged signal. A new signal transition is movement and resets that quiet phase; the ceiling is not wall-clock time from the first 👀.
- **It is a cooling-off signal, not a guarantee.** Five quiet minutes is evidence the PR stopped moving, not proof no review is coming. Report "looks ready — your call," never "safe to merge"; a stalled lifecycle uses the stronger cautious-ready disclosure and resume path from SKILL.md.

## Concurrency

- **Lock.** The script takes a file lock around each state read/write. It cannot span the agent's mutations (which happen between script calls), so it is necessary but not sufficient.
- **Pre-mutation claim and revalidation.** Before a `BEHIND`/`DIRTY` external mutation, claim the exact item, then immediately prove its observed head and base OIDs are still current. A moved head or base invalidates the stale action. Treat the snapshot as a hint, never as a guarantee the world is unchanged at mutation time.
- **Interrupted local merge.** On re-entry, inspect the checkout and remote before acting. Reconcile an interrupted merge to the already-validated commit or abort it safely; never begin another merge over unknown local state.

## Managed-stack continuation

Sequential babysitting is available only while a fresh probe positively reports `manager_status == "confirmed"` for the active PR and the run posture is `stack-ready` or `stack-land` (or `target` after the one-time offer is accepted — which selects `stack-ready`). It uses one active PR target and one watcher, never a watcher per stack layer. On an authorized transition, stop the old watcher, re-read `gh stack view --json`, require the next PR to be the manager's immediate open entry and either non-draft or explicitly included by the user, check out that branch, and initialize its own state directory with `--continue-invocation` plus the same recorded values on the same flags the first snapshot used — `--invocation-id`, `--session-started-at` (the anchor flag, not `--invocation-started-at`), and `--invocation-budget-seconds` — **and `--continue-dead-time-seconds <prior layer's `invocation_dead_time_seconds`>`** so the shared active-time budget carries the suspended time already excluded on earlier layers — **and re-state the same `posture:`**. One fixed budget covers the entire accepted traversal rather than restarting per PR; each layer's state dir accumulates its own dead time, so omitting the carry value would re-count the prior layer's excluded suspend as active. The transition condition under `stack-ready` is quiescence (zero actionable backlog, no standing residual — needs-human, blocked-failing, stack-blocked, open/claimed currency — and no delegate in flight), not settle; landing under `stack-land` still requires the full settled gate. Arm the active watcher with `--downstack-pr <N>` for every open lower layer so a lower layer that gains a new thread, comment, failing check, or head wakes `downstack-actionable`; also recheck downstack quiescence at transitions, immediately before mutation, and at readiness. On either signal return to the lowest re-opened layer rather than writing to both concurrently. Loss of manager confirmation ends continuation.

Under `stack-land`, after settle the caller-owned land step merges the bottom-most open settled PR then syncs before continuing; recipes live in `references/stack-commands.md`. A just-landed MERGED outcome is a transition, not a Terminal exit for the run.

The one-time semantic-scope offer (under `target`), posture table, and draft/human boundaries live inline in SKILL.md because they are routing decisions, not detector mechanics. A manual dependency chain never enters this continuation path; it remains target-local even when its base/head relationships have the same shape.

## Edge cases

- **Managed stack:** `target_needs_rebase` true/unknown becomes `stack-blocked`; do not use `gh pr update-branch` or a local base merge. Before a delegate may push the target, record the manager-ordered open branches at or above the target and each remote-tracking OID (see SKILL.md pre-push baseline); if clean worktree or confirmed membership fails, stop without delegating. Do not stop for missing atomic multi-ref proof (`github/gh-stack#216`). After an authorized target push, retain the pushed SHA, re-confirm that local `gh stack view --json` still owns the target/current branch, require a clean worktree, fetch the target branch, and verify its local and remote-tracking heads remain at the pushed SHA. Select the first open dependent immediately above the target, then run `gh stack rebase "<first-dependent-branch>" --upstack --no-trunk --remote <tracking-remote>` followed by `gh stack push --remote <tracking-remote>` only — never raw force; if there is no dependent, skip the cascade. Quote the branch name. Starting at the dependent excludes the target from the rebase, and verify the target local head is still unchanged before pushing. The rebase confines the cascade to inter-branch propagation. After push success or rejection, re-probe the target against the pushed SHA and every **open dependent** in the baseline against recorded OIDs and expected tips — do not treat the target's intentional post-push OID change as divergence; treat partial dependent updates as observed progress and name the first rejected or divergent dependent layer in a recoverable residual. Prefer all-or-none when the installed manager proves atomic push, but never assume it. This manager-owned continuation is implicit in babysitting a managed layer. On a rebase conflict, run `gh stack rebase --abort` and leave a `needs-human`/upstack residual; on target movement or lease rejection, leave the residual and never retry with raw force. If local CLI membership cannot be re-confirmed, do not import or guess at the stack. Never claim stack readiness until manager order, ancestry, review, and CI are re-proven on every current head.
- **Manual dependency chain:** keep the requested PR as the target, qualify readiness relative to its parent, and report downstream impact. An eligible emitted `normal-base` item may be repaired target-locally, but never rebase, rewrite, restack, or otherwise mutate its dependent branches. A root with open child dependents remains eligible; a target push may make those children stale, which is a residual only.
- **Normal-base `BEHIND`:** require `host_branch_update_capability == true`; denied/`false` or `unknown` becomes `needs-human`, and that capability is never treated as Git push or direct push authority. Claim the exact item and revalidate its observed head and base OIDs. Invoke the host update operation once through GitHub's `PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/update-branch` endpoint with `expected_head_sha` set to the claimed observation's head SHA; never use an update helper that cannot transmit that precondition. Treat an HTTP 422 head mismatch as a stale claim: re-snapshot and reconcile without resubmitting. Host acceptance or a `mutation-observed` outcome is not completion. Confirm only after a fresh snapshot plus ancestry evidence proves the resulting head contains the observed base OID and the currency gate is clear. Remote head movement alone is not proof.
- **Normal-base `DIRTY`:** `host_branch_update_capability` is irrelevant and does not apply. Separately prove ordinary direct push authority to the exact head ref without mutating; unknown or denied proof parks. Require a verified clean PR-head checkout at the observed head, fetch the exact observed base OID, and perform a non-mutating merge preview against it. Fingerprint the sorted conflicted paths and stage blob identities, explicitly excluding the base OID. If `parked_semantic_fingerprints` is present, record `--currency-inspected-fingerprint` before any claim: an unchanged fingerprint remains parked, while changed evidence retires the old park and reopens the item.

  A resolution is mechanical only when positive intent evidence leaves no reasonable alternative behavior. Two plausible resolutions, a material intent change, stale/unauthorized/incomplete evidence, or unbounded work requires safe abort and the shared typed currency residual above; pass `--semantic-conflict-fingerprint <fingerprint>` with its residual mark and include options, tradeoffs, and a lean. For a mechanical case, claim and revalidate, merge the exact observed base, and mark `--currency-outcome mutation-observed` when the local merge starts. Resolve only the previewed conflict, validate proportionally, and use a normal push. Never rebase or force-push. Confirm only after the remote head equals or contains the validated merge commit and a fresh snapshot clears the gate; remote head movement alone is not confirmation. An interrupted local merge must reconcile or abort safely.
- **Manager/relationship probe error:** continue review and CI streams, but perform no branch-currency mutation and do not declare ready until classification succeeds.
- **External head change / force-push:** the head SHA moved under the loop. The snapshot clears SHA-scoped CI state automatically; just re-snapshot. Never clobber unrelated pushed work.
- **PR closed or merged externally:** detected as `pr_state != "OPEN"` on any tick → clean exit with a final status — **except** a just-landed MERGED from this run's authorized `stack-land` land step, which is a layer transition (see Managed-stack continuation above), not a Terminal exit.
- **needs-human decision:** Persist the complete returned residual once through the shared mark, surface it immediately, and leave every covered review thread open. Keep handling independent streams. In interactive continuous mode the decision remains a standing residual that blocks merge-ready and stack advancement without ending the watch; in `mode:pipeline`, return the canonical set as soon as no autonomous work remains. Never auto-decline, auto-resolve, or wait silently on the decision.
- **No push access / fork PR:** a delegated push will fail. Detect that from the delegated skill's result, report it, and stop — the loop cannot make progress it has no permission to make.
- **CI that never completes:** a check stuck `IN_PROGRESS` for a long time will keep the loop from settling. When the invocation budget is reached — either the 8h **active** cap (`invocation_elapsed_seconds`, which excludes suspended time) or the 3-calendar-day **wall-clock backstop** (`invocation_wall_elapsed_seconds`) — hand back with the measured `invocation_elapsed_seconds` and the `max_runtime_ceiling` that fired; never substitute the age of persisted PR state or automatically start another budget.
- **Rate limits / transient API errors:** honor the reset time, back off, resume. The claim→confirm protocol protects against replay.

## Sustaining the watch (Step 5, full text)

**The self-sustaining watch runs autonomously after scope is set.** It never asks permission for the fixes, pushes, replies, resolves, and PR-description refreshes it owns, and a stack-wide posture does not re-ask at each layer. In interactive continuous mode, re-arm after a tick that reached neither a true stop nor a managed-stack transition; a standing residual stays visible and blocks readiness or advancement while the watch continues around it. In `mode:pipeline`, apply the bounded stop above instead: when the canonical decision set is non-empty and no autonomous work remains, return it immediately rather than re-arming.

Re-arm `watch` after any mutation that moved the head with the same invocation ID, start, and budget. A not-ready-but-not-blocked state is neither a stop nor a question; keep waiting for the background sentinel. Watcher silence carries no PR-state information; it means only that no wake condition has fired. Never infer review state from silence. When the user asks for status before a wake, run a fresh `snapshot` with the same invocation fields and report that state. The loop's only interactive question is Step 1's one-time confirmed-managed-stack posture and scope choice under `target`.

In **checkpoint mode** you are done after Step 4 — the next tick is the user re-running the skill. Because every tick is resumable from disk, each wake (a `watch` sentinel, a scheduler fire, or a manual re-run) is a clean re-entry into Step 2.

## Edge cases summary

`references/watch-loop.md` covers these in full. The non-negotiable ones: classify `pr_chain` and consume an exact claimed `branch_currency` item before any base-movement mutation; use the positive host-capability route for `BEHIND` and the clean-checkout exact-base route for bounded mechanical `DIRTY` repairs; semantic, stale, ambiguous, or unauthorized outcomes park rather than retrying or guessing; a pre-existing managed target currency problem becomes `stack-blocked`, never an ordinary base merge; after an owned target push, maintain a locally confirmed managed upstack through Step 7 and abort cleanly on conflict; external head change / force-push → re-snapshot and reconcile rather than clobber unrelated work; PR closed out from under the loop → clean exit; `needs-human` feedback → record it, keep doing independent CI work, never auto-resolve someone else's thread; no push access / fork PR → prove the appropriate route before mutation or park it; rate limits → honor reset headers and back off.
